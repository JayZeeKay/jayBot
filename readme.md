# jayBot

This is my personal bot that my friends and I have been playing around in my Discord server to do some basic routines. It's totally spaghetti code but I'm pretty proud of this bot because I wrote it from the ground up. It has some fun commands like a coin flip and eight ball. I've also recently added the ability to play Youtube audio as well as mp3 attachments in a vc (I haven't seen a bot that can do mp3 attachments!).

Resources I used to write the bot:
* https://discordjs.guide/
* https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome
* and of course, StackOverflow

There's some commands that are only for personal use, but I'm leaving it there so I can look back at it later; looking back at the changes this bot goes through.
